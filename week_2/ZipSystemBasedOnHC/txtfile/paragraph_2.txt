Rathje's hypothesis probably explains part of the complex process of Mayan state formation,
but it suffers from the objection that suitable alternative raw materials can be found in the
lowlands. It could be, too, that warfare became a competitive response to population growth and
 to the increasing scarcity of prime agricultural land, and that it played an important role in
 the emergence of the Mayan states.
