In 334 B.C. Alexander the Great took his Greek armies to
the east and in only a few years completed his creation of an
empire out of much of southwest Asia. In the new empire, barriers
to trade and the movement of peoples were removed; markets were
put in touch with one another. In the next generation thousands
of Greek traders and artisans would enter this wider world to seek
their fortunes. Alexander's actions had several important consequences
for the region occupied by the empire.
