Ganymede, another of Jupiter's satellites and the largest in our solar system,
is also cratered, but less so than Callisto. About one-quarter of its surface seems to
be as old and heavily cratered; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the sparse
 covering of impact craters as well as the relative freshness of the craters. Ganymede is a
 differentiated world, like the terrestrial planets. Measurements of its gravity field tell
 us that the rock and metal sank to form a core about the size of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of
 ice floating above it. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field, the signature of a partially molten interior.
Ganymede is not a dead world, but rather a place continuing geological activity powered by an internal heat source. Much of its surface may be as young as half a billion years.
